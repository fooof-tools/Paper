# Paper

The FOOOF method and tool is described in the 
[Parameterizing Neural Power Spectra](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00744-x) paper.

The paper includes a series of investigations and applications of the algorithm, all of which have openly available code repositories demonstrating the analyses, which are described and linked here.

### Power Spectrum Model

The power spectrum model itself is implemented and available in the
[FOOOF](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) repository.

This repository covers:
- Figure 1, overlapping nature of periodic and aperiodic spectral parameters
  - this schematic figure is also available in [code](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/auto_motivations/measurements/plot_PeriodicAperiodicFeatures.html#sphx-glr-auto-motivations-measurements-plot-periodicaperiodicfeatures-py) as part of the documentation
- Figure 2, algorithm overview
  - is figure is a variant of one of the [tutorials](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/auto_tutorials/plot_03-FOOOFAlgorithm.html#sphx-glr-auto-tutorials-plot-03-fooofalgorithm-py) from the documentation

### Simulations

The power spectrum model was tested on simulated data, which is available in the 
[SimFOOOF](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/SimFOOOF/) repository.

This analysis covers:
- Figure 3, algorithm performance on simulated data
- Figure S2, algorithm performance on simulated data across a broader frequency range
- Figure S3, algorithm performance on simulated data that violate model assumptions
- Figure S5, methods comparisons of measures of the aperiodic component

### EEG Data

The power spectrum model was applied to both resting state and task electroencephalography (EEG) data, 
which is available in the [EEGFOOOF](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/EEGFOOOF/) repository.

This analysis covers:
- Figure 5, age-related shifts in spectral parameters during resting state
- Figure 6, event-related spectral parameterization of working memory in aging

### MEG Data

The power spectrum model was also applied to a large collection of open-access magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, which is available in the [MEGFOOOF](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/MEGFOOOF) repository.

This analysis covers:
- Figure 7, large scale analysis spectral parameters in of resting state MEG data
- Figure S4, oscillation band occurrences and relative powers
